# oops  - solving a problem byy creating object is one of the most common way to solve the problems in python.
class number:
    def sum(self):
        return self.a + self.b


num = number()
num.a = 1
num.b = 24
s = num.sum()
print(s)


# class is a blueprint for the object and object is an instance of the class.
